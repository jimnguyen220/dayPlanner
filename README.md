# dayPlanner

The goal of this project is to create a scheduler to add events to a daily planner.  These events will be stored to the local storage where we can set and get the information. The calendar is also color coded to update with the current time. If the time has passed, the text box will be greyed out, the present time will be red, and future time is green.  Some starter code is already given.  A screen shot of how it displays is below:

The goal of this project is as follows:
```
-Current Date is displayed when the planner is opened
-The time blocks for the planner displays standard business hours
-The time blocks are color coded to indicate if the date is past, present, or future
-Each time block allows the user to enter test and saves the information to local storage 
-The information is still displayed even if the page is refreshed
```

This is what the page looks like after it is finished:
